              <li> tracking of one's green behaivor</li>
              <li> mechanisms to reward such behavior (such as with tree planting)</li>
              <li> social media functionality to connect green leaders with their
              communities and like-minded peers.</li></ul>

    <h3>Your Carbon Footprint:</h3>
    <p>Your carbon footprint is the primary metric to evaluate how green you
      are across all activities. It also fortunately corresponds with how much
      tree-planting or other activities you can undertake to offset your carbon outputs!
      Get started by estimating your C footprint with these steps from UC Berkeley's
      <a href="https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/calculator">CoolClimate tool</a>:</p>
